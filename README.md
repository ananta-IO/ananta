Ananta IO is a website designed for people and their projects. It is founded around the core belief that projects thrive in the open. Therefore it must be dead simple to share what you are working on, as well as discover what your neighbors are working on. Ananta IO addresses this problem by creating a database of projects and the humans who love them. The ananta website is open source... Voil√†! And we are constantly improving our feedback tools on the website, namely Marq, so non-programmers can easily contribute as well. For more background visit the [about section](http://ananta.io/about) of the website.
